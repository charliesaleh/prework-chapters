# Often, you’ll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate
# these you can use Python’s if-elif-else syntax. Python executes only one
# block in an if-elif-else chain. It runs each conditional test in order until
# one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and
# Python skips the rest of the tests.
