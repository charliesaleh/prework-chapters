# Using a Flag

# We set the variable active to True in Line 23 so the program starts in an active
# state. Doing so makes the while statement simpler because no comparison is
# made in the while statement itself; the logic is taken care of in other parts of
# the program. As long as the active variable remains True, the loop will continue running because of line 24.
